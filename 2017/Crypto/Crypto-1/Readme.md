# DRDO CTF 2017 : Crypto-1

**Category:** Crypto

**Level:** Easy

**Points:** 50

**Solves:** 75

**Description:**

A Commander got a **HEXADECIMAL** message and an image but doesnâ€™t know how to read it. He called a cryptographer and asked for help. The cryptographer solved it and said its **perfect secrecy**. Lets see if you can solve it.

`Crypt-Message: 0A130607127764113A6A227416106F340B0E0D08155C`

## Write-up

1. Perfect Secrecy means it is One-Time-Pad which is bascially byteswise XOR of key and plaintext.

2. Open the image in hex-editor. Last bytes in the images are key bytes.

![hex\_key](hex_key)

Therefore key is: ``NABHRATNA_{FLYWITHAIR}`` which is of exactly same lenght as the crypt-message.

3. Now byteswise XOR of crypt message and key will result in the flag.

```Python
key = "NABHRATNA_{FLYWITHAIR}"
crypt = "0A130607127764113A6A227416106F340B0E0D08155C".decode('hex')
plain_hex = ''.join(hex(ord(a) ^ ord(b))[2:].zfill(2) for a,b in zip(key,crypt))
bytearray.fromhex(plain_hex)
```
