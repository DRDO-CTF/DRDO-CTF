**Category:** Reverse Engineering

**Level:** Moderate

**Points:** 100

**Solves:** 14

**Description:**

An automated machine gun control center was captured by the army, but it was not possible to stop the automated ongoing firing until commanding officer overrides the system.
There was a password with commanding officer, who died, using which this system can be controlled. An engineer analysed the control center software and found a program which authenticates the user.
He found that complete strength of password is not used and system used weak encryption based authorization to validate the password. He is still trying to guess the CHARACTERS OF PASSWORD...
If you can help him now, he will surely help you.
