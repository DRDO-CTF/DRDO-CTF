# DRDO CTF 2017 : ReverseEngg-9

**Category:** Reverse Engineering

**Level:** Hard

**Points:** 200

**Solves:** 35

**Description:**

The RED Team developed a binary obfuscation method and applied their obfuscation method to this binary. They challenged the BLUE team that itâ€™s next to impossible to deduce the flag by reversing this binary. The BLUE team took the challenge and using their vast experience, they found out that the RED team has infact used a popular mechanism to hide API calls from static analysis. They are sure that using dynamic analysis and little patience they can win the challenge. Help the BLUE team crack the binary and recover the KEY.
